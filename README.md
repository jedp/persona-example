#Introduction to Mozilla Persona

This app shows how to incorporate [Mozilla
Persona](https://persona.org) into your website.

##To Run

This is a Node.JS program.  I wrote it for Node.JS because it allows
me to write JavaScript on both the client and server, and even if
you've never used Node, I figure the odds are good that you can read
JavaScript.

So to run it, here are the steps:

1. Download [Node](https://nodejs.org) and install, if necessary
2. Git clone this repo
3. In the repo, run `npm install`
4. In the repo, run `npm start`
5. In your browser, visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
